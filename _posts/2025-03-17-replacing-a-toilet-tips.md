# Replacing a Toilet: It's Pretty Simple

Plumbing work can be pretty intimidating, but replacing a toilet is one of the simpler plumbing projects to work on. F

## Tools and Materials You'll Need

- New toilet (tank, bowl, seat, wax ring, mounting bolts)
- Adjustable wrench
- Channel-lock pliers
- Putty knife
- Bucket and sponge
- Rags and towels
- Rubber gloves
- Hack saw (may be needed for old bolts)
- Silicone caulk
- Level

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Preparation

Before starting, measure your space! Ensure you purchase the right size toilet for your bathroom. Toilets come in different heights, bowl shapes, and rough-in distances (the measurement from the wall to the center of the drain).

Turn off the water supply valve and flush the toilet to empty the tank. Disconnect the water supply line from the tank and drain any remaining water using a sponge and bucket.

### 2. Removing the Old Toilet

Remove the tank first by unscrewing the nuts connecting it to the bowl. Then, remove the caps covering the bolts at the base of the toilet and unscrew the nuts. Gently rock the bowl to break the wax seal, then lift straight up.

Pro tip: Have a bucket and towels ready - there will be some water left in the trap!

### 3. Preparing the Flange

Clean the old wax from the flange using a putty knife. Inspect the flange for damage and repair if necessary. This is critical for preventing future leaks.

### 4. Installing the New Toilet

Place the new wax ring on the flange (not on the toilet). Position the toilet bowl over the mounting bolts and press down firmly to create a seal. Level the toilet before tightening the nuts - use plastic shims if needed.

Install the tank following the manufacturer's instructions, being careful not to overtighten the bolts, which can crack the porcelain.

### 5. Finishing Touches

Connect the water supply, turn it on slowly, and check for leaks. Apply a thin bead of silicone caulk around the base of the toilet where it meets the floor, leaving a small gap at the back (this allows any leaks to be visible rather than trapped under the toilet).

Install the toilet seat and give everything a final check.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Overtightening bolts (cracked porcelain is a costly mistake)
- Forgetting to replace the wax ring
- Improper leveling
- Ignoring flange damage
- Rushing the caulking process before checking for leaks

## Final Thoughts

Replacing a toilet is satisfying and cost-effective DIY project. Take your time, follow these steps, and you'll save hundreds of dollars in plumber fees while upgrading your bathroom.
