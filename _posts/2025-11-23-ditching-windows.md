## Time to

It's late 2025, companies have given up any illusions about caring for end user experience or customer satisfaction. Ignoring the ballooning of prices of goods and services globally, a particular set of companies have decided that they command enough of the market to force unwanted products onto their users.  Recent examples that spring to mind are Google and their misleading AI search summaries and Chamberlain disabling third party integrations. As a person that less technical people come to for advice about technology, I deem it my responsibility to be the largest detractor I can for these businesses due to their practices. I like to fight back in my own little way wherever I can, whether thats voting with my wallet and taking business elsewhere or just ceasing use of a product/service altogether. This week, I decided to turn away from Windows entirely.

I do not have a journey to explain or tell (maybe an embarrassing interview story to tell when I switched my laptop to bluefin and forgot about it). It really was as simple as choosing bazzite, booting from my live ISO and installing the OS. I have an Nvidia GPU and I haven't run into many problems with games at all.

The most intimidating part of it all is that I don't know Linux as much when it comes to daily driving it. 2 days ago, I didn't know what KDE was or how you could possibly rebase an OS, but the experience so far has been lovely without that knowledge.

This post isn't intended to be self congratulating nor am I expectant to receive praise for my decision making, I just want to encourage other people to give switching from Windows a try.
