## Summary

In this multiverse story Deadpool is approached by a man named Paradox who intends on vaporizing his entire universe because apparently it's not supposed to go on living without the now deceased hero Wolverine. Deadpool kidnaps another version of Wolverine to replace but this only results in Paradox banishing both Deadpool and Wolverine.

## My Review

I rated this movie 9/10.
