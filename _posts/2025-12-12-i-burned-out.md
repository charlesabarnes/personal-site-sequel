In 2024 I burned out hard. I didn't care about work or code. I kept missing out on personal and professional obligations and deadlines.  It was as if I was sick. I traditionally am the type of person who can code every day without fail or exhaustion. In the workplace I try to solve every problem I can get my hands onto. I truly didn't think burning out was something I could conceivably do.   When it happened, it wasn't something that I could immediately identify and it wasn't sudden.  It wasn't until my removal from the situation I was in that I was able to overcome and learn about my affliction.

### What is burnout

You can likely find a ton of definitions and descriptions of burnout.  From a quick search, my favorite is "Burnout is a state of emotional, mental, and often physical exhaustion brought on by prolonged or repeated stress." ([[Psychology Todayhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/burnout]]).  The definition while simple may map apply different to you in a slightly different way.

### Flash-point

As with most things, there were a variety of causes.   There were weeks where the number of working hours touched over a hundred hours.  At the time, I also had a large breadth of responsibilities at work that I hadn't had at any other point previously in my career.   The largest contributing factor in my opinion was doing work without making any noticeable difference.

I probably output the largest number of code changes that I will ever make in my life. Superficial statistics like number of code revisions or number of commits far exceeded values that would be normal, even accounting for the fact that I was contributing to 5 projects at the same time.   After all of that work and effort though, I don't think I am able to takeaway any notable accomplishments.  

I did not have have a partner in product management. Guidance from leadership was opaque and often conflicting with previous guidance.  My role's charter was carte blanche in name only.   In such a situation, I found myself often doing work multiple times to make up for missed implementation details from the previous attempts.   Retreading ground so often made me lose my sense of purpose and I lost checkpoints of progress.  

Unfortunately while in this situation, I took all of my work problems as a series of personal character flaws.  I sought professional coaching and saw therapists and learned many things about myself (apparently I am neurodivergent), but I never reached the satisfactory answer I needed.

If it wasn't for external forces and loved ones in my life, I don't think that this story would've had a positive end.  After a notable week where I clocked over 100 hours of doing work, I remember remember looking in the mirror at a person who was unrecognizable.    I had gained 60 lbs in the last year, I had noticeable darkness under my eyes.    I think when I my wife (then girlfriend), saw me, her concerned expression put me over the edge and I had to make for a tearful release.

### Remaining embers

Fortunately, it wasn't too long until I was able to get another job offer.  The job search process was confidence inspiring and I was able to avoid a tangible pay cut.   Others saw my potential value and it paid dividends in my self esteem.  

The recovery wasn't instant, I didn't realize the extent of the problem for a few months.  I had no motivation to work on personal projects or do more than the minimum amount of required hours at work.

Paradoxically, I didn't consider myself well recovered until I was laid off in March.  At this time, I was able to fully embrace time to myself, enjoy the beautiful spring and outdoor time, and focus on my health and fitness.

In retrospect I guess burning out makes sense.  I favor work on the frontend because of the shortened feedback loop in comparison to other development work.   I need to keep making forward progress to give myself meaning.   I was spending so much time mimicking Sisyphus instead of delivering great experiences.
