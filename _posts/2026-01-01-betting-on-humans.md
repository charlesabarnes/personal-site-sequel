My personal for hypothesis is that [meatspace](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/meatspace) will become a lot more "hip".   Meeting in person and/or personal intimate connection will be the most popular thing for younger people.   In 2020, the response to COVID outbreaks pushed our workplaces to be remote and our socializing online - requiring us to adapt to our lives to keep in touch.    In response, I have anecdotally noticed that outdoor activities have boomed since.  I believe with the lack of authenticity and eroded trust on the internet, there will be renewed vigor to seek out thoughtful human-to-human experiences.

I personally don't know how it will manifest at a broader scale.  Maybe there will be a larger emphasis on craft and care instead of mass produced products.  Maybe it will mean that we would see a revival and transformation of the [third place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place).   I hope that this will lead to a full rejection of social media, but I know that is extreme wishful thinking.

In the technology world I am "divesting" fully from personalized algorithms and the apps that push them.   I am relying on RSS feeds from a few trusted publications/blogs that I know.  Discoverability is handled by recommendations from the publications or by trusted connections.  I intuit that this workflow helps avoiding doomscrolling or spending time being bothered by generated, bait, slop, or "brainrot" media.

On top of this, I think [FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt) about "AI"/LLMs will fade into the background.  I do believe that it will make workflows pretty efficient, but like novel machine learning techniques before, it will only enhance product experience where there is already a solid user story.  

Maybe this document is more of a wish than a prediction, but I wanted to make my thoughts public.   Happy New Year everyone.
