## Summary

Elly Conway, a reserved writer of spy stories who rarely ventures outside, finds her life entangled with actual secret service operations as the narratives she pens eerily mirror the operations of a menacing covert group. Aiden, professing to be an agent, intervenes to protect her from potential abduction or worse. Suddenly, Elly, along with her cherished feline, Alfie, find themselves navigating a shadowy realm filled with deceit and illusions.
