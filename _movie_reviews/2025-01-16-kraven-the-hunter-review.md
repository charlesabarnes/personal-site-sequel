## My Review

I rated this movie 4/10.

The best of the 2024 bad movies

I can appreciate what this movie was aiming for. Among the other "Sonyverse" films, I think this one stands out as an improvement. Aaron Taylor-Johnson gave a solid performance as Kraven, and the depiction of the character’s abilities was genuinely fun to watch. The action sequences were well-shot and edited, adding some much-needed energy.

That said, the movie has its share of glaring issues. The story felt underwhelming; character motivations were murky, there were several illogical decisions, and for a movie about "the hunter," there wasn’t much actual hunting.

The ADR was painfully obvious, and some of the editing choices were downright jarring.

It also feels like Sony lacks confidence in their tone. Scenes were often disrupted by jokes or awkward interjections undermining any tension or weight.

Hopefully, this is the end of the Sonyverse experiment.
