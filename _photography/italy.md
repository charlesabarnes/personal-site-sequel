This collection is a number of glamour photos that I took while exploring italy with my fiance and the inlaws.  The trip took us to Rome, Venice, Florence, Pompeii, and Cinque Terre.  I had a great amount of food, views, and wine.

Some of the photos are from my phone, and some are from my DSLR. Some of the photos are merged from multiple exposures in Lightroom.
